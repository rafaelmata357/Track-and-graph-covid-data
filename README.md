# Track-and-graph-covid-data
Python app to track and graph the daily covid data using the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dataset (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data)
The script uses the Pandas and Numpy libraries to process the data and matplotlib to create the charts.

Two charts with the accumulated cases are generated with the app:
- Top countries 
- Central America region  and MÃ©xico
